    - Japanese is a syllabic language: consonants require an additional "U" or "I."
    - No true "V" sound → replaced by "B."
    - "R" and "L" sound the same, but are always written as "R."
    - Sound for "Ha", "Hi", "He", "Ho" exists, but not "Hu". Instead they use "Fu."
    - "Wa" sound exists, but not "Wi", "We", "Wu", "Wo."
    #note-label(
      "👉 Fun Fact: They have a character for \"Wo\" (を & ヲ), but it pronounced \"O\" like the \"O\" from (お & オ).",
